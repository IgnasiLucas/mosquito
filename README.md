# Mosquito

This is a re-analysis of some preliminary sequence data from Culex pipiens
form pipiens and form molestus. Individual samples were sequenced at a very
shallow depth. Previous analyses showed a quite low level of mapping success
to the reference genome of Culex quinquefasciatus. Chimeric reads are suspected
to be frequent.

The goal is to compare the two ecotypes.
